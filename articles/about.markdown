>What an extraordinary situation is that of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he feels it - by Albert Einstein.

 It is very hard to define one's own self. Even if you try to define yourself, it is very difficult to be precise as people change over time, something that nature has taught us; not to be stuck with good ol' times. I've tried defining myself many times in past just to notice that the definition is obsolete and it is time to start start defining myself again from scratch.

I'm **Arvind Kunday**. I live in Chennai, with my parents and a lot of computers. I'm currently working with Thoughtworks, an market leader in delivering software the agile way. I've worked mostly with C# for more than 3 years and finally fell in love with Ruby and Scheme recently. Most of my current work with my company revolves around Ruby and Rails. I've worked with [Intel](http://intel.com "Intel") and 360 Degrees Interactive(a startup) before. I graduated from [Coimbatore Institute of Technology]("http://citindia.com" "CIT") with a Msc in Software Engineering. 

I'm in love with Technology, Books and Music. My interests in technology range anything from distributed systems to DNA Mapping. I read a lot of books relating to meta-cognition and world culture. You can find the list of my favourite books [here](http://www.shelfari.com/arvindkunday/shelf "My Shelf at Shelfari"). 

I'm a strong believer of rights for everyone and I'm aware all are equal regardless of race, color, gender or country. I'm sick with people who seem to differ from this point of view. If you believe that all rights are for everyone, you can sign the Universal Rights Declaration Manifesto [here](http://www.everyhumanhasrights.org/do-you-believe-every-human-has-rights "Human Rights Maninfesto") . I am also a strong supporter of feminism with just an exception to it, all are equal.

Why do you write here?
-----------------------
Oneliner - Selfish reasons. I get interested in things time and then and do some related reading on it. I needed to keep track of them and at the same time share it out with the world hoping that someone might find it useful. If you have any comments, just send me a hi to kunday.com(just to confuse bot's). I'm always hoping to get in touch with anyone who share the same interests.
