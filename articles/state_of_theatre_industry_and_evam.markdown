State of Theatrical Industry and Evam
=====================================

Recently , *Sunil Vishnu*, co-founder of Evam entertainment gave a talk at the [**Banyan Tree Series**](http://www.thoughtworker.com/banyan-tree-series "Banyan Series")  at [Thoughtworks Chennai Office](http://thoughtworks.com "Thoughtworks"). This article is the summary of what Sunil Vishnu spoke at the event.





Theatrical industry is under the brink of extinction and considered even to be non-existent. Running such a non-existent business is really a challenging one. Sunil Vishnu talked about how college professors(both these guys are management grads from mica) and even legends like Naseerudeen Shah asked them to pursue this in part time stating that it was difficult to make money in theatrical industry. But these guys were determined to run this business and with an initial investment of just 2 lakhs that they shelled out from their pockets and now they run a profitable company whose 2008/9 revenue was 1.9 Crore.

Sunil Vishnu and Karthik met at the Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad during their MBA graduate studies. Both of these guys had done some stage dramas before and met during a college festival. They both worked together as directors for the next drama 


* Started the business with 2 lakhs
* Cover the difficulties enough, but missed some parts of them - effect of reading outliers
